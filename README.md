#### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
##### - To make software that’s easy to maintain, read, and adapt, I focus on creating code that’s modular and transferable. For instance, the CRUD module from Project Three can be seamlessly used in Project One and Project Two for reading, updating, and deleting database entries. This modular approach speeds up production and results in applications that are straightforward to troubleshoot and fix.

#### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
##### To approach software like a computer scientist, I rely on critical thinking as a primary tool. I begin by analyzing the challenge. Once I understand the requirements, I can evaluate various solutions and choose the best fit. From there, I create test cases with pass and fail metrics aligned to each requirement. These test cases guide me as I build tools to tackle the problem, then implement and debug the new application. I plan to keep using this approach to develop high-quality software and applications.

#### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
##### Computer scientists start by identifying a challenge, interpreting it, and then testing their solution. This process is key to creating high-quality, user-friendly software for clients. Tackling these challenges is essential for learning and growth. Modularly developed software offers companies a shortcut, making it easy to swap out or reuse components across projects—saving time and resources for companies like Grazioso Salvare
